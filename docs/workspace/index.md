# Workspace

## What is a Workspace?

A **Workspace** is the top-level organizational unit in Usertune. It serves as a container that helps you organize and manage your content projects.

## Key Concepts

- **Organization**: Group related content together under a single workspace
- **Isolation**: Each workspace operates independently with its own content and settings
- **Ownership**: Every workspace belongs to a specific user who controls access and permissions
- **Flexibility**: Use workspaces to separate different projects, environments, or client work

## Common Use Cases

- **Multi-environment setup**: Separate staging and production content
- **Client organization**: Dedicated workspaces for different clients or projects
- **Team collaboration**: Shared spaces for content creation and management
- **A/B testing**: Isolated environments for testing different content strategies
