# Testing

## Overview

Testing is a crucial part of building effective personalization with Usertune. The dashboard provides powerful testing capabilities that allow you to validate your Content containers and Variants before deploying them to production.

## Why Test Your Content?

Testing ensures that:
- **Variants are selected correctly** based on your conditions
- **Payload processing works** with different context data
- **Personalization variables** are replaced properly
- **Fallback scenarios** work when expected data is missing
- **Complex conditions** evaluate as intended

## Testing Features

### Dashboard Testing
Test your content directly in the Usertune dashboard with simulated user data to see how your variants respond to different contexts.

### API Testing
Programmatically test your content using API calls with custom context data to validate behavior in your application environment.

### Comprehensive Validation
Test all aspects of your personalization logic including condition matching, payload processing, variable interpolation, and edge cases.

## What You Can Test

### Context Simulation
Simulate different user scenarios by configuring:
- **Geographic Data** (`geo.xxx`) - Test location-based targeting
- **Time Data** (`time.xxx`) - Test time-sensitive content
- **Custom Attributes** (`attribute.xxx`) - Test user segmentation

### Content Validation
Verify that your content works correctly:
- **Condition Logic** - Ensure variants are selected properly
- **Variable Processing** - Check that dynamic content renders correctly
- **Fallback Behavior** - Test scenarios when data is missing
- **Edge Cases** - Validate unusual or boundary conditions

## Testing Workflow

1. **Configure Test Context** - Set up fake data to simulate user scenarios
2. **Execute Tests** - Run tests to see which variants are selected
3. **Validate Results** - Verify that the output matches expectations
4. **Iterate and Improve** - Adjust conditions and payloads based on test results
