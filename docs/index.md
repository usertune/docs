# Usertune Documentation

Welcome to **Usertune**, a dynamic content personalization platform that delivers tailored experiences to users based on real-time context and behavior.

## What is Usertune?

Usertune empowers developers and content creators to build personalized user experiences without complex infrastructure. Our platform provides the tools and APIs you need to deliver the right content to the right user at the right time.

## Core Concepts

Usertune is built around three main concepts that work together to create powerful personalization experiences:

### [Workspace](workspace/index.md)
Your organizational hub for managing content projects. Workspaces provide isolation and structure for different environments, clients, or projects.

### [Content](content/index.md)  
The personalized material delivered to your users. Content items use templates with variables and conditional logic to adapt based on user context.

### [Variant](variant/index.md)
Different versions of content that enable A/B testing and experimentation. Variants help you optimize user engagement through data-driven decisions.
